If your ship was sitting still, it would have zero transversal velocity, and it would be very easy for guns to hit you. As a general rule, the faster your ship moves, the greater its transversal velocity, but only if you move your ship laterally across the face of the hostile vessel shooting you. <br><br>
If you were to fly directly towards a hostile gunship you would have a very low transversal velocity, regardless of your speed, and guns would be able to hit you easily.
